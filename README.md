# Comparative-Analysis-of-European-Option-Pricing

This project aims to explore and compare two foundational methods for pricing European options: the Binomial Tree model and the Black-Scholes model. Both techniques are widely used in financial engineering and quantitative finance, but differ significantly in approach, assumptions, and computational characteristics. The objective is to understand these differences, implement both models, and analyze their accuracy and efficiency using real-world data for European call and put options.
